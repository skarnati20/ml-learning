# ML Learning

A repo where I try to learn ML from the ground up, implementing the major advances in code.

## Repo Structure
* `feed_forward/` - An implementation of a traditional feed-forward MLP
* `mnist/` - The MNIST dataset
* `tools/` - A place that has important tools for testing models
* `test.py` - A file that tests each implementation
* More to come!

## Remaining Work
* ~~Implement a FFNN~~
* Implement a CNN
* Implement an RNN
* Implement an LSTM
* Implement a Transformer
* Investigate Reinforcement Learning
